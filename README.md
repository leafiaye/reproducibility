# Reproducibility Workshop Slides

These are slides for my presentation at the "Coding, Computing, and Workflow Best Practices" workshop at the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison on September 6th, 2022. I introduce the concept of reproducibility and explain why it should be a goal in
social science research.

Slides were created in PowerPoint. I created a template called "Data_nerd_slides", which is also available in the repository. 
You can feel free to use this template for your own presentation.
