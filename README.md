# Reproducibility Workshop Slides

These are slides for my presentation at the "Coding, Computing, and Workflow Best Practices" workshop at the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison on September 6th, 2022. I introduce the concept of reproducibility and explain why it should be a goal in
social science research.

Slides were created in PowerPoint, with templates in the repository as well.
