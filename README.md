# Reproducibility Workshop Slides

These are the slides for my presentation at the "Coding, Computing, and Workflow Best Practices" workshop at the University 
of Wisconsin-Madison on September 6th, 2022. I introduce the concept of reproducibility and explain why it should be a goal 
in social science research.

Slides were created in PowerPoint. I created a template called "Data_nerd_slides", which is also available in the repository.
This template is stylized to look like an R Studio script. For the template to display correctly, you need to have the
font "monaco" installed on your computer (which is the default font in R Studio): https://github.com/cstrap/monaco-font

Feel free to use this template for your own presentation.
